# Investigate_Dataset_Project
I dowloaded a dataset from Kaggle which includes information about 10,000 movies collected from The Movie Database (TMDb), including user ratings and revenue. Then I performed DAP(Data Analysis Process) to get useful insights from the raw data and answered the following questions:-

Q1. What has been the trend of number of movies released per year?
Q2. Which actors have been casted most in the movies released from 1960-2015?
Q3. Which directors have directed the most number of movies released from 1960-2015?
Q4. What has been the trend of movie runtime over the years?
Q5. Movies of which genre have been released over time? Also how many of movies of the top genres have released over the years 1960-2015?
Q6. Over the years, how have the movies performed in terms of profit?
Q7. Is there any relationship between the popularity of a movie and it's Budget, Revenue or Profit/Loss?
What is correlation coefficient?
Q8. Is there any relationship between the rating of a movie and it's Budget, Revenue or Profit/Loss?
