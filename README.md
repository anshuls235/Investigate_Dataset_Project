# Investigate_Dataset_Project
I dowloaded a dataset from Kaggle which includes information about 10,000 movies collected from The Movie Database (TMDb), including user ratings and revenue. Then I performed DAP(Data Analysis Process) to get useful insights from the raw data and answered the following questions:-

- What has been the trend of number of movies released per year?
- Which actors have been casted most in the movies released from 1960-2015?
- Which directors have directed the most number of movies released from 1960-2015?
- What has been the trend of movie runtime over the years?
- Movies of which genre have been released over time? Also how many of movies of the top genres have released over the years 1960-2015?
- Over the years, how have the movies performed in terms of profit?
- Is there any relationship between the popularity of a movie and it's Budget, Revenue or Profit/Loss?
What is correlation coefficient?
- Is there any relationship between the rating of a movie and it's Budget, Revenue or Profit/Loss?
